This LabVIEW example demonstrates changing the color within a selected image region (ROI) using an OpenLvVision function and a Data Value Reference (DVR) for efficient in-place pixel modification.

1.  **Get ROI from Image Control:**

    * Retrieves the currently defined Region of Interest (ROI) from the "Image" control.

2.  **Create Data Value Reference (DVR):**

    * The "OLV ImageToDVR" function (2) takes the image reference and returns a Data Value Reference (DVR) to the image data.
    * The "Inplace Element Structure" allows direct manipulation of the image data *within* the DVR without creating a full copy. Only data entering or leaving the structure is copied.

3.  **Index ROI Coordinates:**

    * Indexes the array representing the ROI coordinates. Assuming the ROI is represented as an array of four elements:
        * Index 0: Left coordinate of the rectangle.
        * Index 1: Top coordinate of the rectangle.
        * Index 2: Right coordinate of the rectangle.
        * Index 3: Bottom coordinate of the rectangle.

4.  **Calculate ROI Dimensions:**

    * Calculates the width and height of the selected ROI:
        * Width = Right coordinate - Left coordinate
        * Height = Bottom coordinate - Top coordinate

5.  **Allocate Color Array:**

    * Allocates a new array filled with the selected color. The dimensions of this array are determined by the width and height of the ROI calculated in the previous step. 

6.  **Replace Array Subset (Within DVR):**

    * The "Replace Array Subset" function (6), operating *within* the DVR's Inplace Element Structure, modifies the pixel data of the original image.
    * **Important Note:** For image data within a DVR, the row and column indexing be rotated compared to a standard LabVIEW image.

7.  **Release Data Value Reference (DVR):**

    * The "Delete Data Value Reference" function (7) releases the DVR.
    * **Crucial:** It is essential to close (delete) DVRs when you are finished with them. Failure to do so can lead to unexpected behavior and potential issues with data integrity and memory management.

8.  **Draw Image to Control:**

    * The modified image (now with the ROI filled with the selected color) is drawn again onto the "Image" control, updating the displayed image with the changes made within the DVR.
