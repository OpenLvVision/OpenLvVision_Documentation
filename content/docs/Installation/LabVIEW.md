2. **Choose the Appropriate License:**
    * If you possess a commercial LabVIEW license, proceed with that version.

## 2. Install LabVIEW

After downloading, follow these steps to install LabVIEW:

* **Mount the ISO (If Applicable):**
    * If the downloaded file is an ISO image, you'll need to mount it. In Windows, you can typically do this by double-clicking the ISO file. This will create a virtual drive.

* **Run the Installer:**
    * Navigate to the newly created virtual drive (or the location where you extracted the installer files).
    * Locate the `Install.exe` file.
    * **Important:** Right-click on `Install.exe` and select "Run as administrator." This ensures the installer has the necessary permissions.

* **NI Package Manager:**
    * The LabVIEW installer often begins by installing the NI Package Manager. This is a tool that helps manage NI software installations. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the NI Package Manager installation.

* **LabVIEW Installation:**
    * Once the NI Package Manager is installed, the LabVIEW installation process will start.
    * Carefully follow the on-screen instructions. You may be presented with options to customize the installation (e.g., selecting specific modules or drivers). If you're unsure, the default settings are usually a good starting point.

* **JKI VI Package Manager:**
    * During the LabVIEW installation, you may be prompted to install the JKI VI Package Manager. It is highly recommended that you enable this.The JKI VI Package Manager is a valuable tool for managing LabVIEW libraries and add-ons. **It will later be used to install OpenLvVision.**

* **Start LabVIEW:** Launch the LabVIEW application.

* **Initiate Activation:**
    * You'll likely be prompted to activate LabVIEW upon the first launch. If not, there should be an option in the "Help" menu to activate the software.
    * Select the option to "Check my account for licenses."
