OpenLVVision is built from several key libraries:

* **[Vision Development Module](/docs/installation/vision-development/)** – Provides core image function implementations in LabVIEW.  
  **Note:** For an executable, you'll need to install the Vision Development runtime.  
* **[Image](/docs/installation/openlvvision/#2-image-module)** – Fundamental open-source image processing functions.  
* **[Overlays](/docs/installation/openlvvision/#3-overlays-module)** – Tools for managing graphics and images placed on top of a base image.  
* **[OpenCV (Preview)](/docs/installation/openlvvision/#4-opencv-preview)** – A widely used, free, open-source library for computer vision and image processing.

## 1. Installing JKI VIPM

All OpenLvVision packages are distributed via the **[JKI VI Package Manager (VIPM)](https://www.vipm.io/)**.

1. **Download VIPM** from [vipm.io/download](https://www.vipm.io/download/) and install it.

2. **Enable the LabVIEW VI Server** (required for VIPM to communicate with LabVIEW):  
   - Open **LabVIEW**.  
   - Go to **Tools → Options → VI Server**.  
   - Under **TCP/IP**, check **Enable TCP/IP**.  
   - Leave the **port** at its default value (each LabVIEW version has its own default port).  
   - Restart LabVIEW.

#### Offline Installation

If you do not have internet access on the target machine, you can install the module manually.  

1. **Download the required files** from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/OpenLvVision/OpenLvVision_OpenCv/releases):  
   - The `.vip` file (the package itself)  
   - `DLLs.zip`  
     - Use `DLLs_x64` for **LabVIEW 64-bit**

2. **Install the `.vip` file manually** via VIPM (see instructions in [Installing JKI VIPM](#1-installing-jki-vipm)).  

3. **During installation**, VIPM will display a window *“Checking Connection”*.  
   - If the installer cannot connect, it will automatically prompt you to select the downloaded `DLLs.zip`.  
   - If it does **not** prompt automatically:  
     - Press the **Cancel** button next to the download bar.  
     - VIPM will then ask for the DLLs file manually — select the downloaded `DLLs.zip`.
